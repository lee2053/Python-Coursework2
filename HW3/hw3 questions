1.Answer the question: where can you find the Standard Documentation for Python?
 

2.Write an algorithm for step 3.
 

3. Write a program that asks the user for a path to a directory, then updates the names of all the files in the directory that contain the word draft to instead say final
     EX: "term paper (draft).txt" would be renamed "term paper (final).txt"

 

BONUS (5pts): for any .txt file that your program changes the name of, have your program add a line of text that states "Edited on " followed by the current date to the end of the text in the file that it is editing.
