2. Create a MySQL table on your burrow account that has all the information contained in the cd_catalog. What types you use for your fields are up to you.
 
3. Create an HTML page to ask the user what CD criteria they want to search for. This page should submit to a cgi page.
 
4. The cgi page should display a table with all of the CDs that match the criteria the user submitted.
