Around one-quarter inch of ice glazed trees and power lines, on top of one-quarter to one-half inch of sleet. Roads became ice-covered and very hazardous. Numerous vehicle crashes and slide-offs occurred. Isolated power outages were reported due to tree limbs on power lines. A utility company estimated outages totaled about 500 customers. Downed tree limbs damaged vehicles at the campus of Southern Indiana University. Several east-to-west bands of light to locally moderate precipitation advanced slowly northward in response to the arrival of warm, moist air in the low levels. Strengthening of a southerly low level jet occurred ahead of a 500 mb shortwave impulse emerging out of the central Plains. Convective enhancement of precipitation rates was observed. After the precipitation changed to rain, the combination of snowmelt and rainfall produced localized street flooding. Most of the street flooding was in urban areas, such as Evansville.","Intersections around the city were flooded. At the Evansville airport, the storm total precipitation was 1.21 inches.",CSV
